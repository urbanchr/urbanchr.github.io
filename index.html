<B>Nominal Isabelle</B> 
I am the main developer of Nominal 
<A HREF="http://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle</A>. This is joint work with 
<A HREF="http://www21.in.tum.de/~berghofe/">Dr Stefan Berghofer</A>,
<A HREF="http://sketis.net/">Dr Markus Wenzel</A>,
<A HREF="http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/users/cek/">Dr Cezary Kaliszyk</A>,
<A HREF="http://user.it.uu.se/~tjawe125/">Dr Tjark Weber</A> and 
the Isabelle-team in Munich.
Many of the theoretical ideas originate from the nominal logic project - a wonderful project headed 
by <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/">Prof. Andrew Pitts</A>.  
The aim with this work is to make formal reasoning involving binders as simple as 
on paper and the hope is to lure  
<A HREF="http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/cgi-bin/poplmark/index.php?title=The_POPLmark_Challenge#Vision">masses</A> to automated
theorem proving. My funding for this work was provided in 2004 and 2005 by a research 
fellowship from the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt">Alexander-von-Humboldt</A>
<A HREF="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de">foundation</A>. During this time I was a visitor in the group of 
<A HREF="http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/">Prof. Helmut Schwichtenberg</A> in Munich.
Between 2006 and 2011 this work is supported by an

<A HREF="https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/">fellowship</A> at the TUM.
There is a <A HREF="https://urbanchr.github.io/Nominal/">webpage</A> about Nominal
Isabelle, which also includes a list of projects that use Nominal Isabelle.
Users of Nominal Isabelle had their papers appearing at LICS, POPL, FOSSACS, SOS, TPHOLs, CPP, SEFM,
the Haskell Symposium and
in the Journal of Automated Reasoning. Nowadays, Nominal Isabelle 2 is part of the <A HREF="https://www.isa-afp.org">Archive of Formal Proofs</A>.

<B>Real-Time Scheduling and Priority Inheritance</B>
  In real-time operating systems with processes, resource locking and
  priority scheduling, one faces the problem of
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion">priority inversion</A> (processes
  with lower priority block processes with higher priority indefinitely). If you do not prevent this problem,
  then processes can behave erratically, as <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</A> found out the
  <A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.54.html#subj6">hard</A> way with their first
  <A HREF="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-pathfinder-sojourner-rover/">Mars Pathfinder mission</A>.
  The priority inheritance protocol is a widely used scheduling algorithm that prevents
  priority inversion. However, the <A HREF="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/12.57058">original paper</A>
  describing this algorithm contains an incorrect algorithm and a bogus(!) correctness proof.

  We formalised our version of the priority inheritance protocol, including a generalisation
  of the original work (we allow overlapping critical sections) in the theorem prover
  <A HREF="http://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle</A>.

  In our formalisation we use the inductive method we learned from
  <A HREF="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/">Prof. Larry Paulson</A>.
  He used this method in order to prove the correctness of cryptographic
  protocols. We have implemented our algorithm on top of the
  the small <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos">PINTOS</A>
  operating system used for teaching (we passed all their test cases and were
  faster than their reference implementation).

  
  While the problem with the original algorithm was already known for some time, the incorrect
  specification seems to be still widely in use and described in many textbooks on real-time operating systems,
  including famous and rather expensive
  ones. Feel free to decide whether they are worth your time and money. Task: Spot the problems in

  Alternatively, you can look at the quotes and pointers in our
  <A HREF="http://urbanchr.github.io/Publications/pip.pdf">paper</A>. A notable
  exception is the <A HREF="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461406754">textbook</A>
  by Buttazzo, who gives the correct specification. Unfortunately, his work did not
  help us with proving the correctness of the priority inheritance protocol.

  PLA University of Science and Technology in Nanjing.

<B>Myhill-Nerode and Regular Expressions</B> 
Out of frustration of having to teach reasoning in theorem provers with worn-out examples like
fib and even/odd, we implemented a large part of regular language theory in Isabelle/HOL.
This <A HREF="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Myhill-Nerode.html">implementation</A> 
gives rise to much more interesting examples, as shown 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/regexp/jfp.pdf">here</A> and 
<A HREF="http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~kwang/paper/06-jfp-yi.pdf">here</A>. It turns out that
formalisations of automata theory are a huge 
<A HREF="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-isabelle-users/2005-September/msg00012.html">pain</A> 
in theorem provers, especially in those that are based on HOL. 
We therefore went against the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/papers_by_year.htm#K97a">mainstream</A> 
and used in our formalisation regular expressions exclusively,
because they are much more convenient for formal reasoning. The results we
formalised include: the Myhill-Nerode theorem, the closure of regular languages
under complementation, finiteness of derivatives of regular expressions and a surprising 
result about Subseq, which according to 
this 
<A HREF="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/01/theorem-that-should-be-better-known.html">blog</A> 
should be better known. We also answered a
<A HREF="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/02/proving-dfa-langs-closed-under-concat.html">question</A> from the same blog about
"proving Reg-exp-langs [being] closed under complementation without using equiv to DFA's"....yes we can!

Zhang and his student Chunhan Wu from the 
PLA University of Science and Technology in Nanjing.

<B>Nominal Unification and Alpha-Prolog</B> 
<A HREF="https://urbanchr.github.io/Unification">Nominal unification</A> is one outcome of 
my involvement in the nominal logic project in Cambridge. Another is the logic programming language 
alpha-Prolog (joint work with <A HREF="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/">Dr James Cheney</A>), 
which uses nominal unification - click for details 
<A HREF="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/">here</A>.
The nominal unification algorithm has been 
<A HREF="https://urbanchr.github.io/Unification">formally verified</A> in Isabelle. This 
was possible  since this unification algorithm is formulated in a simple first-order language 
(unlike other algorithms for higher-order unification). 
<A HREF="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/maribel.fernandez/">Prof. Maribel Fernandez</A> and her student
improved the nominal unification algorithm to be quadratic. 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/">Prof. Daniel Friedman</A> and his group use nominal 
unification in their alpha-Kanren system implemented in Scheme. This work has also found its
  way into <A HREF="http://clojure.org">Clojure</A> as the <A HREF="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/core.logic.nominal">core.logic.nominal</A> package.
